Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed service providing cloud storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. Use the extension to deploy static websites and Single Page Apps (SPAs) and browse Azure Blob Containers, File Shares, Tables, and Queues.

**Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurestorage/wiki) for additional information about the extension.**

## Features

* Explore/Create/Delete Blob Containers, File Shares, Queues, Tables and Storage Accounts
* Create, Edit, and Delete Block Blobs and Files
* Upload and Download Blobs, Files, and Folders
* Access Connection String and Primary Key
* Open in Storage Explorer for memory or computationally heavy tasks, or for Page and Append Blob support.

## Installation

1. Download and install the [Azure Storage extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage) for Visual Studio Code
2. Once complete, you'll see an Azure icon in the Activity Bar
    > If your activity bar is hidden, you won't be able to access the extension. Show the Activity Bar by clicking View > Appearance > Show Activity Bar
3. Sign in to your Azure Account by clicking Sign in to Azure...
    >  If you don't already have an Azure Account, click "Create a Free Azure Account" for a free 30-day account with $200 in Azure credits to try out any combination of services.

## Deploy your Single Page App to Azure Storage

Once you are signed in to your Azure account and you have your app open in Visual Studio Code, right click the Storage accounts item and select "Create Storage Account... (Advanced)"

1. Type a globally unique name for your Storage Account and press Enter. Valid characters for an storage account name are 'a-z' and '0-9'
2. Create a new Resource Group and accept the default name
3. Choose a location in a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/regions/) near you or near other services you may need to access
    > It may take up to a minute for the account to be created
4. When prompted, choose "Enable website hosting" to configure your storage account for static site hosting
5. Enter 'index.html' for the index document path
6. Enter 'index.html' for the 404 error document path
    > Index.html is used for the error document because modern Single Page Applications (SPAs) such as React will handle errors in the client. For classic static websites, use the error document to customize your 404 page.

Once you have created your Storage Account, right click on the Storage Account and select "Deploy to Static Website via Azure Storage...".

> Tip: Looking for a sample app to deploy? Run `npx create-react-app my-react-app` to create one

Make sure you've compiled your app (run `npm run build` if you created a sample from create-react-app) prior to deploying it to Azure.

Select the build output from your current workspace if you have your app open already or browse to the directory containing your compiled application code
    > If you have a `build`, `out`, or `dist` directory, you'll see it as an option to deploy from.

Once the deployment completes, click **Browse to Website** in the prompt to view your freshly deployed website.

## Settings

Use these configuration settings to customize the Azure Storage extension.

* `azureStorage.showExplorer`: Set to `false` to hide Azure Storage Explorer
* `azureStorage.preDeployTask`: Set to the name of a task to be run before deploying a static website.
* `azureStorage.storageExplorerLocation`:  [Mac only] Set to `"Path/To/Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer.app"` to override the default location.
* `azureStorage.file.showSavePrompt`: Set to `false` to prevent showing a warning dialog on File file save.
* `azureStorage.blob.showSavePrompt`: Set to `false` to prevent showing a warning dialog on Blob file save.
